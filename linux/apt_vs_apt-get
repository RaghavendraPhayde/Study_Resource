apt vs apt-get
1. Both are package management tools
2. apt tool combined its operation from apt-get and apt-cache
3. apt tool is widely used cause it is very much user friendly by enabling colors and progressbar in its outputs 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
apt
	apt 1.2.32ubuntu0.1 (amd64)
	Usage: apt [options] command
	
	apt is a commandline package manager and provides commands for
	searching and managing as well as querying information about packages.
	It provides the same functionality as the specialized APT tools,
	like apt-get and apt-cache, but enables options more suitable for
	interactive use by default.

	Most used commands:
	  list - list packages based on package names
	  search - search in package descriptions
	  show - show package details
	  install - install packages
	  remove - remove packages
	  autoremove - Remove automatically all unused packages
	  update - update list of available packages
	  upgrade - upgrade the system by installing/upgrading packages
	  full-upgrade - upgrade the system by removing/installing/upgrading packages
	  edit-sources - edit the source information file

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
apt-get
	apt 1.2.32ubuntu0.1 (amd64)
	Usage: apt-get [options] command
		   apt-get [options] install|remove pkg1 [pkg2 ...]
		   apt-get [options] source pkg1 [pkg2 ...]
	apt-get is a command line interface for retrieval of packages
	and information about them from authenticated sources and
	for installation, upgrade and removal of packages together
	with their dependencies.

	Most used commands:
	  update - Retrieve new lists of packages
	  upgrade - Perform an upgrade
	  install - Install new packages (pkg is libc6 not libc6.deb)
	  remove - Remove packages
	  purge - Remove packages and config files
	  autoremove - Remove automatically all unused packages
	  dist-upgrade - Distribution upgrade, see apt-get(8)
	  dselect-upgrade - Follow dselect selections
	  build-dep - Configure build-dependencies for source packages
	  clean - Erase downloaded archive files
	  autoclean - Erase old downloaded archive files
	  check - Verify that there are no broken dependencies
	  source - Download source archives
	  download - Download the binary package into the current directory
	  changelog - Download and display the changelog for the given package

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
apt-cache
	apt 1.2.32ubuntu0.1 (amd64)
	Usage: apt-cache [options] command
		   apt-cache [options] show pkg1 [pkg2 ...]

	apt-cache queries and displays available information about installed
	and installable packages. It works exclusively on the data acquired
	into the local cache via the 'update' command of e.g. apt-get. The
	displayed information may therefore be outdated if the last update was
	too long ago, but in exchange apt-cache works independently of the
	availability of the configured sources (e.g. offline).

	Most used commands:
	  showsrc - Show source records
	  search - Search the package list for a regex pattern
	  depends - Show raw dependency information for a package
	  rdepends - Show reverse dependency information for a package
	  show - Show a readable record for the package
	  pkgnames - List the names of all packages in the system
	  policy - Show policy settings
